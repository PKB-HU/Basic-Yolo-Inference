## YOLOv12n Real-Time Object Detection

This project uses the YOLOv12n model for real-time object detection via webcam, optimized for slower machines.

ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Install the dependencies using pip:

    pip install ultralytics opencv-python

Ensure you have a compatible YOLOv12n model file : yolo12n.pt.

ðŸš€ How to Run

    python main.py

Replace detect.py with your script filename if different.
The program will:

  - Open your webcam.

  - Use YOLOv12n to detect objects.

  - Draw bounding boxes and labels with confidence scores.

  - Display the result in a window.

  - Press Q to exit the window.

ðŸ§  Model Info

    yolo12n.pt is a lightweight YOLOv12 model ideal for devices with low computational power.

    Adjust or change the model path if you have a different version.

ðŸ›  Notes

    This example uses cv2.VideoCapture(0), which captures from the default webcam. Change the index if needed.

    Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.

    Tested with Ultralytics ultralytics library version >=8.0.
